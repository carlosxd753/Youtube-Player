# Youtube Player

It's an app similar to Youtube, to make it work you need to clone it and then create an ".env" file on the directory, then you need to get an API KEY from RapidAPI Hub => Youtube v3, then save it like this: VITE_RAPID_API_KEY=2ffcabffe8msh0bc550e1b4d5cfdp1fe39ejsn9f0ea3f7c630 (It's an example)
